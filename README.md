# README Generator App

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to make a command-line application that generates a professional README file. It is important for developers to include a high quality README so that other individuals can understand their projects, ask to contribute, or build off of what was previously created. I built this project so devlopers can have a simple method of generating a README, with all of the required sections and input necessary for the file. This application solves the problem of developers having to create a README by scratch for it provides a template of questions that automatically generates a README file upon completion of the prompts. It saves developers from spending too much time on a README by creating one within their command line. I learned how to create a command-line application during this process, using node.js and npms to formulate a working, polished app.

## Installation

To install this app, add the repo to your terminal and then type in node index.js. Usage will be described below.

## Usage

Once the app is installed, open your terminal and write node index.js. Upon doing so, you will be prompted with a series of questions that will create the content of your README. The next question will populate once your answer to the prior question has been entered. Once you reach the question regarding the license on your project, use your arrow keys or space bar to navigate through the choices then enter the license you wish to have. Once you have completed each prompt successfully with no errors, you will receieve a message that signals your README has been created. You will see that a file named READMEgenerated has populated in your directory and your answers to the prompts will have been entered to the correct sections. Here is a link to a walkthrough video that shows users how to navigate the app. [README GENERATOR WALKTHROUGH](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IQsaCBkSJB6IsdHjjBlwcuTcTp7aJSt7/view).
